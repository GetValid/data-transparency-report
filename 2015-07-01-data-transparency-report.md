## Twilio Transparency Report for the First Half of 2015
 
Twilio’s developer ecosystem, customers and end users rely on us to protect
their personal information, sensitive data and user privacy. That includes how
Twilio handles government requests we receive.

This is Twilio’s first transparency report detailing requests for customer
information by municipal, state, provincial and federal governments globally.
As part of our commitment to the privacy of your data, this semi-annual report
represents the start of a program to produce clear visibility to the Twilio
community around the governmental requests we receive.

In that spirit, this report’s objective is to inform you of the total volume of
government requests for information received by Twilio, how Twilio responded to
the requests and how often Twilio notified users of the requests.

Notes:

* "Customer Contact Information" includes information such as a Twilio
  customer’s user name, email address, company name or company contact
  information, where available.
* "Specified User Content" includes any information provided beyond Customer
  Contact Information described above. This may include call logs, message logs,
  phone number creation date or other information. We only produced the user
  content specifically indicated in the applicable warrant, subpoena, court
  order or administrative order.
* "Twilio Declined to Furnish" means we did not provide Customer Contact
  Information or Specified User Content. This could be due to insufficient
  documentation, concerns about jurisdiction or unavailable records.  -
  “Requests Withdrawn” means a government agency submitted and subsequently
  withdrew a request. Upon receiving a government request, we notify agencies
  that we intend to disclose the existence of the request to our customer unless
  explicitly prohibited from doing so by law, thus allowing agencies to withdraw
  the request to prevent disclosure.


### What responses to government requests for user information did Twilio provide?

In the first half of 2015, Twilio responded to 170 requests for user
information from government agencies.

Notes:

* "Takedown Request" means a government agency request to remove functionality
  or content. We apply the same scrutiny to government requests to remove
  content as government requests for user information. In evaluating whether we
  will accommodate the takedown request, we apply internal criteria to determine
  whether the request identifies behavior that violates our Acceptable Use
  Policy.
* "Police Force Order" refers to an international law enforcement agency making
  a direct request to Twilio. We apply the same scrutiny to international
  requests as we do for domestic requests.


### Twilio’s Comment on National Security Letters

The data above does not reflect any National Security Letters Twilio may have
received. 

Companies are prohibited by law from disclosing the specific number of National
Security Letters they receive. The US Department of Justice has maintained that
companies may only disclose the number of National Security Letters it has
received in set ranges.

Therefore, Twilio indicates that we have received between 0 and 999 National
Security Letters in the time range of January 1, 2015 through June 30, 2015. 

Twilio opposes this prohibition to disclose the specific number of National
Security Letters received based on our belief that government requests should
not be issued in secret, and only be issued with proper transparency,
accountability and oversight.


### What notifications of government requests for user information did Twilio send to affected customers?

In the first half of 2015, we responded to 170 government requests for user
information and notified our customers in 55 of these requests.

In accordance with our Privacy Policy, Twilio notifies customers of our
compliance with a government request wherever we are not prohibited from doing
so by statute, subpoena or court or administrative order.

Total Government Requests Received First Half of 2015 (Jan 1 - Jun 30): 268
Number of Requests Where Twilio Did Not Notify Our Customer that User
Information Was Produced: 115 Number of Requests Where Twilio Notified Our
Customer that User Information Was Produced: 55 Number of Requests Where Twilio
Declined to Furnish User Information to the Requesting Agency: 74 Number of
Requests Withdrawn by the Requesting Agency Based on Twilio Disclosure Policy:

### Conclusion

Twilio's developers, customers and end users expect our platform to be secure
and private. We are mindful of these expectations and we take seriously the
trust that our customers have placed in us when choosing the Twilio platform.

The 118 customers for whom we have received government requests as indicated in
this report represent a fraction of a percentage of all Twilio accounts. Due to
the restraint on free speech imposed by current law, this report does not
include any requests that may have been subject to National Security Letters.

Twilio will continue to publish our transparency report on a semiannual basis.
Please be advised that we may restate data as we go forward as more complete
information becomes available or if we change our classifications. Current and
archival transparency reports will be available on the Twilio website.
