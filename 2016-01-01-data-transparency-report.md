Notes:

* “Customer Contact Information” includes information such as a Twilio customer’s user name, email address, company name or company contact information, where available.
* “Additional Information” includes any information provided beyond the Customer Contact Information described above. This may include call logs, message logs, message body content, phone number creation date, address on file for a specific phone number or other information. Twilio only produced the user content specifically demanded in the applicable warrant, subpoena, court order or administrative order.
  In the second half of 2015, Twilio furnished the following Additional Information, followed by the number of times that information was furnished in parentheses: Billing or payment information, or physical address associated with a phone number (27); Number utilization such as when a number was added to an account (4); Transmittal records such as call logs or text message logs including sender, recipient and time stamp (8); and Message body content (1).
* “Twilio Declined to Furnish” means Twilio did not provide Customer Contact Information or Additional Information. This could be due to insufficient documentation, concerns about jurisdiction or unavailable records.
* “Requests Withdrawn” means a government agency submitted and subsequently withdrew a request. Upon receiving a government request, Twilio notifies agencies that Twilio intends to disclose the existence of the request to a customer unless explicitly prohibited from doing so by law, thus allowing agencies to withdraw the request to prevent disclosure.

### What responses to government requests for user information did Twilio provide?

In the second half of 2015, Twilio responded to 191 requests for user information from government agencies.

Notes:

* “Exigent Requests” are responses where Twilio may have provided information in advance of receiving a fully executed request from law enforcement. Under Twilio’s privacy policy, Twilio may disclose information to law enforcement in the case of an emergency where there is a danger of death or serious physical injury to a person that Twilio may have information necessary to prevent. Twilio responded to 16 exigent requests in the second half of 2015, and nine agencies ultimately produced a court order, subpoena or search warrant in response to the request.
* “Police Force Order” refers to an international law enforcement agency making a direct request to Twilio. Twilio applies the same scrutiny to international requests as for domestic requests.

### Twilio's Comment on Take Down requests

In the second half of 2015, Twilio received 20 take down requests. A “take down request” means a government agency requested Twilio remove functionality or content.

Twilio applies the same scrutiny to government requests to remove content as government requests for user information. Twilio applies internal criteria to determine whether the take down request identifies behavior that violates the Twilio Acceptable Use Policy. If behavior that violates Twilio’s AUP is identified, Twilio may opt to accommodate the take down request.

### Twilio’s Comment on National Security Letters

The data above does not reflect any National Security Letters Twilio may have received.

Companies are prohibited by law from disclosing the specific number of National Security Letters they receive. The US Department of Justice has maintained that companies may only disclose the number of National Security Letters it has received in set ranges.

Therefore, Twilio indicates receiving between 0 and 999 National Security Letters in the time range of July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015.

Twilio opposes this prohibition to disclose the specific number of National Security Letters received based on the belief that government requests should not be issued in secret, and only be issued with proper transparency, accountability and oversight.


### What notifications of government requests for user information did Twilio send to affected customers?

In the second half of 2015, Twilio responded to 191 government requests for user information and notified the impacted customers of 59 of those requests.

In accordance with the Twilio Privacy Policy, Twilio notifies customers of compliance with a government request whenever not prohibited from doing so by statute, subpoena or court or administrative order.

### Conclusion

Twilio's developers, customers and end users expect the Twilio platform to be secure and private. Twilio is mindful of these expectations and takes seriously the trust that users place when choosing the Twilio platform.

The 163 customers for whom Twilio received government requests as indicated in this report represent a fraction of a percentage of all Twilio accounts. Due to the restraint on free speech imposed by current law, this report does not include any requests that may have been subject to National Security Letters.

Twilio will continue to publish a semi-annual transparency report. Please be advised that Twilio may restate data going forward if more complete information becomes available or if Twilio changes classifications. Current and archival transparency reports will be available on the Twilio website.
