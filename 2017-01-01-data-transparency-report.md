## Twilio Transparency Report for the Second Half of 2016

Twilio's developer ecosystem, customers and end users expect Twilio to protect their personal information, sensitive data and user privacy. That responsibility includes how Twilio handles government requests received.

This is Twilio's fourth transparency report detailing requests for customer information by municipal, state, provincial and federal governments globally for the last six months of 2016. As part of Twilio’s commitment to the privacy of your data, and consistent with our core value of “no shenanigans”, we compile this semi-annual report to provide visibility to the Twilio community around governmental requests received.

In that spirit, this report's objective is to inform you of the total volume of government requests for information received by Twilio in the last six months of 2016, how Twilio responded to the requests and how often Twilio notified its users of the requests.

### What government requests for user information did Twilio receive?

In the second half of 2016, Twilio received 699 government requests for user information across 360 Twilio customer accounts.

Of the 699 requests received, 375 requests came from federal, state and local agencies within the United States, and 324 requests were issued by international agencies.

* Twilio tracks mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) requests served by the United States Department of Justice - Office of International Affairs according to the country that originates the request. Twilio applies the same scrutiny to international requests as for domestic requests.

Notes:

* “Customer Contact Information” includes information such as a Twilio customer’s user name, email address, company name or company contact information, where available.
* “Additional Information” includes any information provided beyond the Customer Contact Information described above. This may include call logs, message logs, message body content, phone number creation date, address on file for a specific phone number or other information. Twilio only produced the user content specifically demanded in the applicable warrant, subpoena, court order or administrative order.
In the second half of 2016, Twilio furnished the following Additional Information, followed by the number of times that information was furnished in parentheses: Billing or payment information, or physical address associated with a phone number (124); Number utilization such as when a number was added to an account (114); Transmittal records such as call logs or text message logs including sender, recipient and time stamp (6). Twilio furnished no Message body content (1) during the second half of 2016.
* “Twilio Declined to Furnish” means Twilio did not provide Customer Contact Information or Additional Information. This could be due to insufficient documentation, concerns about jurisdiction or unavailable records.
* “Requests Withdrawn” means a government agency submitted and subsequently withdrew a request. Upon receiving a government request, Twilio notifies agencies that Twilio intends to disclose the existence of the request to a customer unless explicitly prohibited from doing so by law, thus allowing agencies to withdraw the request to prevent disclosure.

In the second half of 2016, Twilio received requests from the following federal agencies, followed by the number of requests in parentheses: Department of Treasury (15); Department of Homeland Security (17); Department of Justice: Federal Bureau of Investigation (60), Drug Enforcement Agency (48), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (4), Office of the Inspector General (2) and US Marshals Service (1); Federal Communications Commission (1); Federal Trade Commission (4); Securities and Exchange Commission (5); and US District Courts (11).

Notes:

* “Exigent Requests” are responses where Twilio may have provided information in advance of receiving a fully executed request from law enforcement. Under Twilio’s privacy policy, Twilio may disclose information to law enforcement in the case of an emergency where there is a danger of death or serious physical injury to a person that Twilio may have information necessary to prevent. Twilio responded to 30 exigent requests in the second half of 2016, and 13 agencies ultimately produced a court order, subpoena or search warrant in response to the request.
* “Police Force Order” refers to an international law enforcement agency making a direct request to Twilio. Twilio applies the same scrutiny to international requests as for domestic requests.

### Twilio's Comment on Content Removal Requests

In the second half of 2016, Twilio received 24 takedown requests from government agencies to disable functionality on phone numbers associated with Twilio customers' accounts.

A “takedown request” typically means a government agency requested a company remove functionality or content hosted online. Given Twilio's platform, takedown requests typically involve a government agency requesting that Twilio disable a phone number or phone numbers associated with suspected unlawful activity.

Twilio applies the same scrutiny to government requests to remove content or disable phone number functionality as government requests for user information. Twilio applies internal criteria to determine whether the takedown request identifies behavior that violates Twilio’s Acceptable Use Policy. If behavior that violates Twilio’s AUP is identified, Twilio may opt to accommodate the takedown request.

In the second half of 2016, Twilio received government agency requests to disable phone number functionality affecting 13 customer accounts.

### Twilio’s Comment on National Security Letters

The data above does not reflect any National Security Letters Twilio may have received.

Companies are prohibited by law from disclosing the specific number of National Security Letters they receive. The US Department of Justice has maintained that companies may only disclose the number of National Security Letters it has received in set ranges.

Therefore, Twilio indicates receiving between 0 and 999 National Security Letters in the time range of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016.

Recently, in accordance with the USA Freedom Act of 2015, some companies have been permitted to restate ranges of the National Security Letters they have received to positively conclude that they have received requests. Twilio is encouraged by this effort to increase transparency. Twilio continues to oppose the prohibition to disclose the specific number of National Security Letters received by a company, based on the belief that government requests should not be issued in secret, and should only be issued with proper transparency, accountability and oversight.

### What notifications of government requests for user information did Twilio send to affected customers?

In the second half of 2016, Twilio responded to 440 government requests for user information and notified the impacted customers of 142 of those requests.

In accordance with Twilio’s Privacy Policy, Twilio notifies customers of compliance with a government request whenever not prohibited from doing so by statute, subpoena or court or administrative order.

Notes:
* Twilio applies the same scrutiny to international requests as for domestic requests. Certain statutes in the United States, such as the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act and certain state criminal laws, allow requesting agencies to present Twilio with a “gag order” in connection with a request for information. In accordance with certain countries’ statutes, such as German criminal law, Twilio is prohibited by statute from ever notifying the impacted customer, and law enforcement may require non-disclosure even without a special showing to the court. In line with Twilio's objections to the prohibition on disclosing the specific number of National Security Letters, Twilio also objects to the overbroad application of gag orders based on the belief that government requests should only be issued with proper transparency, accountability and oversight.

### Conclusion

Twilio's developers, customers and end users expect the Twilio platform to be secure and private. Twilio is mindful of these expectations and takes seriously the trust that users place when choosing the Twilio platform.


The 160 customers for whom Twilio received government requests as indicated in this report represent a fraction of a percentage of all Twilio accounts. Due to the restraint on free speech imposed by current law, this report does not include any requests that may have been subject to National Security Letters.


Twilio will continue to publish a semiannual transparency report. Please be advised that Twilio may restate data going forward if more complete information becomes available or if Twilio changes classifications.
